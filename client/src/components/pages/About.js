                to try the Balaji Resort. We were totally refreshed and
                rejuvenated for the whole of next year and it was due to the
                relaxing stay at the resort. The resort is absolutely marvelous!
                We liked absolutely everything, starting from the breakfast
                through to the perfect room service including the cleanliness
                and extra services such as dry cleaning and laundry. In general
                all the staff at the hotel were professional, friendly and
                provided excellent service. We will return for sure!"

                and thats putting it mildly. The staff was extremely courteous,
                and when I say this I don't just mean the managerial level. The
                respect and the courtesy offered to us trickled down to the
                waiters and the the watchmen and even the trainees. This place
